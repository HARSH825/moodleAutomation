Watch in action : https://www.linkedin.com/posts/harsh-chhallani1937_moodle-activity-7324898466055311360-ffHf?utm_source=social_share_send&utm_medium=member_desktop_web&rcm=ACoAACgrDisBzNL58sLyNjgND7meaJoN3iWtVVk

This project automates the process of fetching assignments from Moodle, generating assignment documentation, and assisting students in reviewing it — all using **browser automation** via **Playwright**. It's designed to save students time and effort by mimicking real user behavior on Moodle.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Logs into Moodle using Playwright browser automation  
- ✅ Fetches assignments from enrolled courses dynamically  
- ✅ Auto-generates assignment documentation (templated or AI-assisted)  
- ✅ Displays generated documents to the student for review and validation  
- 🛠️ *(Coming soon)* Auto-submits the document to Moodle after user validation  

---

##  Tech Stack

- **Node.js** – Project runtime  
- **Playwright** – For browser automation (login, navigation, submission)  
- **mmammoth.js,docx.js,LLM** – For document generation  
- **Supabase** – For saving generated documents  
- *(Optional integrations like GPT or Templating Engines can be added)*

##  Future Scope

The project is actively evolving. Planned features include:

-  **Auto-submission upon validation**  
  Once the student confirms the document, the system will submit it directly to the corresponding Moodle assignment using browser automation.

-  **Custom document generation based on subject type**  
  The system will generate subject-specific formats depending on the course — such as different styles for lab reports, theoretical writeups, etc., based on user query or context.

-  **Pre-selection of target course(s)**  
  Instead of generating documents for all enrolled courses, users will be able to pre-select specific courses — eliminating unnecessary processing and increasing control.
